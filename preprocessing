/**************************/
/*/ Prepare Monet Dataset
/**************************/

1.	The first thing to do is collecting images.
To select the best images for this task I used an image processing quality assessment algorithm called BRISQUE (Blind/ Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator)
 I used it on both: the Monet images and the regular images and chose the best 30 (Monet) and 500 ( real )

In addition, there is entire documentation explaining how I collected the DB.


2.	Afterward, I sorted them into 4 folders:
trainA, testA, trainB, testB.


3.	The “A” category refers to real images with high-quality scores and the “B” category refers to Monet images with the high-quality score, and the dataset is comprised of train and test elements.

This code will load all photographs and use them as a training dataset.
The photographs are square with the shape 256×256 and
The example below will load all photographs from the train and test folders and create an array of images for category A and another for category B.
Both arrays are then saved to a new file in compressed NumPy array format.
