cycle gan implementation

to make it easier to undrstand please read first the data preprocessing file.

I attached my dive folder with some further explenation.

The same model architecture and configuration are described in the paper and were in use across a lot of image-to-image translation tasks. 
https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/

The implementation is in TF and based directly on the model described in the paper and implemented in the author’s codebase,
designed to take and generate color images with the size 256×256 pixels.

The architecture is: four models, two discriminator models, and two generator models.

I added a link to the DB:
